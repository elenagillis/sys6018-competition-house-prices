C1-3 Kaggle House Prices

Official ReadMe for the C1-3 Team

This project implemented 1 parametric approach and 1 KNN, entirely from scratch rather than using an implementation in a package, for the ["House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" Kaggle Compititon](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

Roles:
For each type of method, everyone came up with their own version. The group then decided who had the best method and worked together to make it more efficient and accurate. 

Score:
KNN: 0.16873
